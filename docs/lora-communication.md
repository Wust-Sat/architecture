    ⚠️ WORK IN PROGRESS ⚠️ - better research required


# LoRaWAN in space

LoRaWAN seems to offer numerous benefits over traditional data transmission solutions.

-   **Long Range:** transmissions over 2000km have been reported.
-   **Low barrier to entry:** cheap off the shelf ground station equipment is available.
-   **World-wide infrastructure:** there are over 1500 ground stations in the Open Source Global Satellite Network.
-   **High power efficiency:** LoRaWAN IoT devices can operate on battery power for years.
-   **Free frequency bands:** no license required.

Its main drawback is low data rate, but it should be enough for telemetry.
